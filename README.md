## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

⏰ At the moment, I'm working on finishing my GCSE exams - which are finishing at the end of June. Therefore, I have stopped working on _most_ projects - but there is a (currently) private project that I'm making small contributions to when I have the time. It's helping me learn more about iOS internals, as well as helping me achieve my goals to learn C and ARM64 assembly. 

💻 If you want to check out any of my existing projects, check out my GitHub repos - but, as a warning, a lot of them are unfinished!
