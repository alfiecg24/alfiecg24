## 📖 About Me

⏰ For the past few weeks, I've been working on [Achilles](https://github.com/alfiecg24/Achilles), a checkm8 utility for iOS devices that helped me learn a lot about the iOS boot chain. I'm now starting a private project so development of Achilles will slow down.

🎯 My goals at the moment are to  continue to expand my knowledge of iOS internals.

💻 If you want to check out any of my existing projects, check out my GitHub repos - but, as a warning, a lot of them are unfinished!
